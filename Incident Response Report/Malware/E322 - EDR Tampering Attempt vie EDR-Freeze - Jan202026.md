Verifying if the IOCs found in this investigation is present in any other device.
→ The source IP address is not found anywhere.
→ No EDR-Freeze_1.0.exe
→ No file hash matched with this: 970c7834e58b6ef22473875167a333dbb33bf7b667d1cb814829f68579cd85f7

The device should be isolated to reduce the impact of the cyber attack.
