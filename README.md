# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Notes, Write-Ups & Incident Response

Hi, I'm **Steven Razanajatovo** (SOC / Security Analyst–oriented).  

This repository is my personal cybersecurity portfolio where I publish:

- ✅ **TryHackMe / Let'sDefend write-ups** (step-by-step investigations)
- ✅ **Incident Response reports** (structured IR documentation)
- ✅ **Security notes & references** (blue team focused)

## 📌 How I Write My Reports / Write-Ups
My structure is consistent so it’s easy to review:

1. **Objective** (what the challenge/incident is about)
2. **Evidence** (alerts/logs/artifacts)
3. **Analysis** (timeline + reasoning)
4. **Actions** (containment/mitigation)
5. **Conclusion** (root cause + recommendations)
6. **Lessons Learned** (what I improved)

---

## 📈 Roadmap (What I’m Adding Next)
- More TryHackMe & Let'sDefend write-ups
- Detection ideas (Sigma / Splunk searches)
- Incident response templates (checklists, timelines)
- Mini projects: parsing logs, automation scripts
